# USD/EUR Exchange Rate Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR) for the upcoming quarter. Using 10 years of historical data, we employ a time series analysis approach, specifically the ARIMA model, to forecast future exchange rates.

## Data
The dataset comprises two primary columns:
- `DATE`: The date of the observation.
- `DEXUSEU`: The exchange rate between USD and EUR on that date.

## Requirements
Ensure you have R installed and the necessary R packages. You can install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
